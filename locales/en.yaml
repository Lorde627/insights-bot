  notification: |
    {{.Name}} @{{.Username}} has detected that your group has been upgraded to to a <b>supergroup</b>, resulting in a change of group ID. <b>We have automatically migrated all historical records and data to the new group ID</b>. All previous settings will stay the same. However, due to Telegram's restrictions, message IDs from before the migration won't match those sent afterwards. This means messages sent before the upgrade won't be included in future summaries. We apologize for any inconvenience.

    ü§ó Welcome to @{{.Username}}!

    - For web page article reading, use the command /smr@{{.Username}} <code>article link</code>.

    - To summarize this group's chat history, set me as this group's admin (permissions can be off) under a <b>recognizable identity</b> (recommended to avoid permission errors), then send /configure_recap@{{.Username}} to activate the chat recap feature.

    - To delete all messages recorded by the bot, simply revoke my admin rights. This will trigger an automatic cleanup of the bot‚Äôs historical data (unless this feature has been altered by another bot maintainer).

    For questions:

    1. Use /help@{{.Username}} to view supported commands.
    2. Visit the bot's <a href="https://github.com/nekomeowww/insights-bot">GitHub repository</a> to ask the developer.

    Enjoy your use!

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Your group is not a supergroup yet, which means the message link reference feature won't work properly.

    To enable message linking:

    - Temporarily set your group to public, then revert it to private.
    - Upgrade to a supergroup through other methods.
